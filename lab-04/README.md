# Lab 04 - Pods

In this lab we will run our first, very basic, application on Kubernetes.  We
will basically run a single pod as our application.

## Task 1: Creating a namespace

Create a namespace for this lab:

```
kubectl create ns lab-04

namespace "lab-04" created
```

Verify that your namespace was created:

```
kubectl get namespaces

NAME             STATUS    AGE
default          Active    1h
kube-public      Active    1h
kube-system      Active    1h
lab-04           Active    7s
```

## Task 2: Starting your first pod

To run your first pod (the official nginx Docker image), run the following
command:

```
kubectl run --generator=run-pod/v1 --image=nginx nginx -n lab-04

pod "nginx" created
```

The above command will create a single pod that is based on the official nginx
Docker image.  Run the following command to verify that the pods has been
created and is in the running state (if the pod is not yet in the running state
wait a couple of seconds and try to run the command again):

```
kubectl get pods -n lab-04

NAME      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
nginx     1/1       Running   0          22s
```

As we have not yet configured any services and/or ingresses we will use a litte
"hack" to access our pod we just created.

Run the following command to forward the port of the pod (in our case port 80)
running in our Kubernetes cluster to a port on your laptop (in this case port
8080).

```
kubectl port-forward pod/nginx 8080:80 --address 0.0.0.0 -n lab-04
```

Now if you're running your cluster via `minikube` go to http://localhost:8080. 
However if you're running your cluster via `kubeadm` in the cloud you should go 
to http://studentX.workshop.gluo.io:8080 , you should be greeted with the 
default nginx welcome page:

![nginx welcome page](images/lab-04-nginx-welcome-page.png)

If that works you can close the port-foward connection by pressing `CTRL+c`.

## Task 3: Connecting to your pod

To connect to your pod, you can use the following command (notice how it
resembles the `docker exec` command in options and functionality):

```
kubectl exec -ti nginx bash -n lab-04

root@nginx:/#
```

Notice how the prompt changes.  `exec`-ing into a pod is very powerful for
troubleshooting, but keep in mind that by default pods/containers are immutable
so remember to not make any changes inside the pods/container.

To exit run the `exit` command.

```
exit
```

## Task 4: Pod logs

Again similar to when working with Docker containers, Kubernetes has a built-in
feature that exposes all stdout/stderr output into logs.  To access those logs
issue the following command:

```
kubectl logs nginx -n lab-04

127.0.0.1 - - [11/Mar/2019:11:40:47 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.52.1" "-"
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Mar/2019:11:40:48 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.52.1" "-"
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Mar/2019:11:40:49 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.52.1" "-"
127.0.0.1 - - [11/Mar/2019:11:40:50 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 612 "-" "curl/7.52.1" "-"
```

> NOTE: if your logs are empty, repeat Task 2 where you `kubectl port-forward`
> the container port and hit reload the page a couple more times in your
> browser

A very handy option of `kubectl logs` is that you can follow them using the `-f`
option, this is extremely useful when troubleshooting:

```
kubectl logs nginx -n lab-04 -f
```

Hit `CTRL+c` to exit the logs.

## Task 5: Cleaning up

Clean up the namespace for this lab:

```
kubectl delete ns lab-04

namespace "lab-04" deleted
```
